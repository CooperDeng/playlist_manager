# playlist_manager

This is sort of a object-oriented coding practice. I realized a playlist manager using c++.

A detailed explanation of this practice could be found in the design pdf file. 

Several input files have also been included. 

This is simply a practice of object-oriented coding and would not be used in any way to make profit.
